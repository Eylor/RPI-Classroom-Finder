# RPI Classroom Finder
## Objective:
The aim of this project is to give students that attend Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute a simple way to route themselves
to their classrooms for the semester. 

###Features: 
####Classroom Routing:
Give our application a classroom, and it will route you from your current location to the door of the classroom.
####Building Search:
Browse and explore the floor plans of the academic buildings at RPI.
####Schedule Upload:
Upload your whole schedule by giving the application your CRN's for the semester and never be late on the first day again!

##TODO:
####(In the near future)
- [ ] Add all floor plans with their cell sheets to database.
- [ ] Indoor routing between floors
- [ ] Tighten up backend, should preform routing on server side.
- [ ] Implement and integrate java and javascript properly to clean up this mess

##Notes:
This is a project being done for RCOS and RPI's SD&D course. Expect lengthy documentation to come!
